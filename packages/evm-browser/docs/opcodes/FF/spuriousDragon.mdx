## Gas

The static gas is {gasPrices|selfdestruct}. If a positive balance is sent to an empty account, the dynamic gas is {gasPrices|callNewAccount}. Otherwise there is no additional cost. An account is empty if its balance is 0, its nonce is 0 and it has no code.

## Gas refunds

Adds {gasPrices|selfdestructRefund} to the gas refunds. See [gas refunds](/about).
