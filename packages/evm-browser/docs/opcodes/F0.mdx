*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Creates a new contract. Enters a new sub [context](/about) of the calculated destination address and executes the provided initialisation code, then resumes the current context.

Should deployment succeed, the new account's [code](/about) is set to the [return data](/about) resulting from executing the initialisation code.

The destination address is calculated as the rightmost 20 bytes (160 bits) of the Keccak-256 hash of the rlp encoding of the sender address followed by its nonce. That is:

    address = keccak256(rlp([sender_address,sender_nonce]))[12:]

Deployment can fail due to:
- Insufficient value to send.
- Sub [context](/about) [reverted](/#FD).
- Insufficient gas to execute the initialisation code.
- Call depth limit reached.

Note that these failures only affect the return value and do not cause the calling context to revert (unlike the error cases below).

## Stack input

0. `value`: value in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the new account.
1. `offset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the initialisation code for the new account.
2. `size`: byte size to copy (size of the initialisation code).

## Stack output

0. `address`: the address of the deployed contract, 0 if the deployment failed.

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
- The current execution context is from a [STATICCALL](/#FA) (since Byzantium fork).
