## Gas

    minimum_word_size = (size + 31) / 32
    code_deposit_cost = {gasPrices|createData} * deployed_code_size

    static_gas = {gasPrices|create}
    dynamic_gas = {gasPrices|sha3Word} * minimum_word_size + memory_expansion_cost + deployment_code_execution_cost + code_deposit_cost

The `deployment_code_execution_cost` is the cost of whatever opcode is run to deploy the new contract.
On top of that, there is an additional cost for storing the code of the new contract, shown as `code_deposit_cost`.
The difference with [CREATE](#F0) is an additional cost to hash the code before.
The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).
