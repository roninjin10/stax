*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

The [memory](/about) is always fully accessible. What this instruction tracks is the highest offset that was accessed in the current execution. A first write or read to a bigger offset will trigger a [memory expansion](/about), which will cost gas. The size is always a multiple of a word (32 bytes).

## Stack output

0. `size`: current [memory](/about) size in bytes (higher offset accessed until now + 1).

## Example

[See in playground](playground?unit=Wei&codeType=Mnemonic&code='jInitiallygkufirst~1mkx39upart%20of%20third~3ms'~mqPOPqjNow%20size%20is%20v%20%2F%2F%20uqMLOADvRead%20q%5Cnm%20wordkqPUSH1gjMSIZEvg%200%01gjkmquv~_)

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
