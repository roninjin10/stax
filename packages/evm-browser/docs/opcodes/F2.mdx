*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Creates a new sub [context](/about) as if calling itself, but with the [code](/about) of the given account. In particular the [storage](/about) remains the same. Note that an account with no code will return success as true.

If the size of the [return data](/about) is not known, it can also be retrieved after the call with the instructions [RETURNDATASIZE](/#3D) and [RETURNDATACOPY](/#3E) (since the Byzantium fork).

From the Tangerine Whistle fork, `gas` is capped at all but one 64th (`remaining_gas / 64`) of the remaining gas of the current context. If a call tries to send more, the `gas` is changed to match the maximum allowed.

## Stack input

0. `gas`: amount of gas to send to the sub [context](/about) to execute. The gas that is not used by the sub context is returned to this one.
1. `address`: the account which [code](/about) to execute.
2. `value`: [value](/#34) in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp) to send to the account.
3. `argsOffset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, the [calldata](/about) of the sub [context](/about).
4. `argsSize`: byte size to copy (size of the [calldata](/about)).
5. `retOffset`: byte offset in the [memory](/about) in bytes, where to store the [return data](/about) of the sub [context](/about).
6. `retSize`: byte size to copy (size of the [return data](/about)).

## Stack output

0. `success`: return 0 if the sub [context](/about) [reverted](/#FD), 1 otherwise.

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Not enough values on the stack.
