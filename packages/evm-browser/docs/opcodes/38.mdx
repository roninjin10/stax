*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Each instruction occupies one byte. In the case of a [PUSH](/#60) instruction, the bytes that need to be pushed are encoded after that, it thus increases the codesize accordingly.

## Stack output

0. `size`: byte size of the [code](/about).

## Example

| * | Input | Output |
|--:|------:|-------:|
| `1` | | `32` |

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
