*Index 1 is top of the stack.*

## Notes

The new value is put on top of the stack, incrementing all the other value indices. The values for a specific opcode thus have to be pushed in reverse order of the stack. For example, with [MSTORE](/#52), the first value pushed would have to be `value`, and then `offset`.

## Stack output

0. `value`: pushed value, aligned to the right (put in the lowest significant bytes).

## Example

| * | * |
|---|---|
| **Code** | `0x60FF6000` |
| **Text** | `PUSH1 FF PUSH1 00` |

| * | Input | Output |
|--:|------:|-------:|
| `1` | | `0x00` |
| `2` | | `0xFF` |

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
