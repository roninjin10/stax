## Gas

    minimum_word_size = (size + 31) / 32

    static_gas = {gasPrices|extcodecopy}
    dynamic_gas = {gasPrices|copy} * minimum_word_size + memory_expansion_cost + address_access_cost

The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).
If the accessed address is warm, `address_access_cost` is {gasPrices|warmstorageread}, otherwise it is {gasPrices|coldaccountaccess}. See section [access sets](/about).
