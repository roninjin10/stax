*Index 1 is top of the stack. See [PUSH](/#60).*

## Notes

Semantically equivalent of calling [BALANCE](/#31) with [ADDRESS](/#30) as parameter, but with a reduced gas cost.

## Stack output

0. `balance`: balance of the current account in [wei](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wei.asp).

## Example

| * | Input | Output |
|--:|------:|-------:|
| `1` | | `9` |

[Reproduce in playground](/playground?callValue=9&unit=Wei&codeType=Mnemonic&code='SELFBALANCE'_).

## Error cases

The state changes done by the current context are [reverted](#FD) in those cases:
- Not enough gas.
- Stack overflow.
