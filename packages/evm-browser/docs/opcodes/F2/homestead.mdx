## Gas

    static_gas = {gasPrices|call}
    dynamic_gas = memory_expansion_cost + code_execution_cost + positive_value_cost

The memory expansion cost explanation can be found [here](/about).

The different costs are:
 - `code_execution_cost` is the cost of the called code execution (limited by the `gas` parameter).
 - If `value` is not 0, then `positive_value_cost` is {gasPrices|callValueTransfer}. In this case there is also a call stipend that is given to make sure that a basic fallback function can be called. {gasPrices|callStipend} is thus removed from the cost, and also added to the `gas` input.
